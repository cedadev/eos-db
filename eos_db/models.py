"""Cloudhands database and security models.

The data model for Cloudhands is heavily subclassed using the concept of
multi-table inheritance. For example, a large number of the models are
subclassed from the Resource class. This usefully represents the fact that an
actor or artifact can have a variety of resources associated with them.

Important concepts:

* Actor: Something that acts upon the system. Could be a user or an agent or
daemon.

* Artifact: Something which is created and then acted upon. An artifact is
acted upon by "Touches" being made to the artifact, in order to apply
"Resources", or change the artifact's "State".
